# Mall Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project uses the Mall Customer dataset provided by [Vijay Choudhary on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) to perform customer segmentation. The primary goal is to cluster customers based on their demographic attributes and spending behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. These insights help businesses target specific customer groups for personalized marketing strategies, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and sales.

- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **Annual Income**: Annual income of the customer (in thousands of dollars).

This dataset enables businesses to understand their customer base and identify distinct groups that can be targeted for specific marketing campaigns.
